php-rest-sample
-----------
This sample provides a library to interface with the REST API.


Requirements
-----------
To use the sample, you will need:
  * Web server running PHP 5.3 or greater
  * The PEAR package manager (http://pear.php.net)
  * XML_Serializer PEAR package (http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.xml.xml-serializer.php)
  * PHPUnit PEAR package (if you intend on running the unit tests)
  
See the php documentation for inforation about installing pear packages.



Installation
------------
Make sure you have a web-server and PHP processor installed. For simplicity it is suggested to run
Z-WAMP (http://zwamp.sourceforge.net/). However for a more scalable solution Apache and PHP can be installed and
configured manually.

Configure 'php.ini' so that the value for 'Date.timezone' matches your location. A list of accepted values
can be found on the PHP website. The values correlate with the universally unix accepted timezone names.
Example: Date.timezone = "America/Los_Angeles"

Install PEAR and use it to install the XML_Serializer package `pear install -f XML_Serializer`

Security Notice
---------------
This package uses BASIC authentication to identify with the server. Usernames and passwords are sent in clear text
and should only be done over a connection that is trusted between the client and the server.
